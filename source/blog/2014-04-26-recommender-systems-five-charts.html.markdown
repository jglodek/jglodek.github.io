## Why 5 charts?
I always wondered how to convey an information to a reader via blog.
To me the long, long articles always seem to be a bad thing.
Instead of building context and providing detailed informations,
different mannerisms occlude the big picture (whether academic ego, startup–savvy or big enterprise BS).
So lets get to brass tacks here — 5 charts, short descriptions, my model, my typology.
