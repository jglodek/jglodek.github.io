## Why 5 charts?
Long articles suck. Instead of building context or providing detailed informations,
different mannerisms writers use occlude the big picture.
Whether it is academic ego, startup–savvy or big enterprise BS there's a lot of bad content out there.

So lets get to brass tacks here — 5 charts, short descriptions, my model, my typology.
Feel free to use any ideas you see here and like. There are several questions spread across the article, I encourage you to think about them and post your answers @jacekglodek on Twitter or in the comment section below.

## Recommender Systems
Quick Intro: Recommender systems, what are these? Well, they are just set of software features that help people use other system's features. They just try to answer the question: <emp>what does users need or want?</emp>, and they show user the best options.
(Notice: They don't make user do something, they usually just recommend it.)

There are a lot of recommeder systems you should know, like: Netflix movie or Amazon book recommendation. Don't let yourself be fooled by the pattern you see here.
Recommendation is a thing that has many more use cases than just e—commerce. What are those?
