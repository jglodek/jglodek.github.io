## Why 5 charts?
Long articles suck. Instead of building context or providing detailed informations,
different mannerisms writers use occlude the big picture.
Whether it is academic ego, startup–savvy or big enterprise BS there's a lot of bad content out there.

So lets get to brass tacks here — 5 charts, short descriptions, my model, my typology.
Feel free to use any ideas you see here and like. There are several questions posted across the article, I encourage to think about them and post your answers @jacekglodek on Twitter or in the comment section below.

## Recommender Systems
Quick Intro: Recommender systems, what are these? Well, they are just set of features that help people use other system's features. They just answer users' need to know what is the best option they can choose to fulfil their interest
(Notice: They don't tell user what to do, they just recommend the options)

There are a lot of recommeder systems you probably know, like: Netflix movie or Amazon book recommendation. Don't let yourself be fooled by the pattern you see here.
Recommendation is a thing that has many more use cases than just e—commerce. What are those?
